This code is running on a Heroku/Python/Flask stack using the SendGrid Parse and Web APIs.

With this code, you can create a DMARC report aggregator parser that can accept an email containing a zipped DMARC aggregate report and store the data received in a DB.

When completed, you will be able to send out a report analyzing the received DMARC aggregate data.
